# CallApp

It's a simple call app that is developed with using Agora.

Get rtcToken, appId and channelName from https://console.agora.io . After that implement these parameters into config file. 

In order to test app I used this web demo link https://webdemo.agora.io/basicVideoCall/index.html and I used same rtcToken, appId and channelName to test application.

In order to add noise cancellation, I gett AccessKey from https://console.picovoice.ai and add this library in my project.
